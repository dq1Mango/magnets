This program draws magnetic fields

adding this to test github

Things we have buttons for:

-Toggle MagnetField,
-Toggle Eelectric field

Things we need buttons for:

-slider for permeability
-slider for permativity
-field "radius"
-someway to define color gradient
-toggle transparent vectors
-toggle between ways to visualize magnitude (color / length)

-mass of new particle
-charge on new particle
-intitial velocity of new particle
-type of "particle" (someway to add non point particles (this could be done in a differt *scene* potentially))

-fov
-key rebindings (this is gonna be fake cuz its gonna be soooooo tedius)
-sensitivity
-framerate (maybe i dont actually know how fps works in godot)

-field density
-field "radius"
